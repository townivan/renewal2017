                <p class="main-header__summary">Costs are going up for insurance companies across America. Why? Reasons include historically low interest rates, an aging workforce, and a sharp increase in claims from some diseases and injuries. When costs go up, prices must often rise, too, so companies have the financial resources to pay claims.</p>

                    <p>To make sure they have the resources to pay employee claims, insurance companies invest some of the benefit premiums they take in.</p>
                    <p>However, interest rates have been consistently low since the 2007 recession, and are likely to stay that way for a while.</p>
                    <p>As the ability to generate interest income goes down, insurance companies across the nation face pressure to raise their premium prices on benefits such as Long Term Disability.</p>

                <p>Two trends are increasing the average age of the American worker:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Baby Boomers are working longer before retiring</li>
                    <li>Younger generations are entering the workforce later, after they go to college</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The older employees get, the more susceptible they are to illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. As a result, they are more likely to file Life and Disability insurance claims.</p>
                <p>Average age affects insurance prices across businessesof similar size, regardless of the actual range of a company's employees.</p>

                <p>Over the last few years, we have seen double-digit increases in claims resulting from causes such as obesity, substance abuse, accidents and suicide. This alarming trend has increased claims costs for insurance companies across the nation.</p>
